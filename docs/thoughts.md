## Mentoring

I've got a solution I want a mentor.

- Can the solution be published and get a mentor?

- WTF happens when I want to send this to a team? Is that a teammate request? Rather than a mentoring request?
- What about if I just want some random person to feedback? Is that a 1-1 team, or can I share a private URL? Is this even a thing or do we just say "join a team together". Too hacky? Sharing with a person sounds fun. Following...?! (:S)
